# Hi Im Mehmet Berk KellecioÄŸlu
At the moment i am a Computer Engineering student in Baskent Universty. I am very interested in writing algorithms and algorithm concepts. Here at my page i post my algorithms for problems, notes that i am taking while writing those algorithms and my other projects that i am developing. Generally my problems are from LeetCode and Codewars but sometimes i'll come up with a problem then try to solve it aswell. Hope you can learn something new from my page. Thank you :)
